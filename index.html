              The school is just opposite to Nagar Bhaban of Sylhet City
              Corporation and within 500 yards from the office of the Deputy
              Commissioner and Sylhet Zilla Parishad. While talking to the flood
              victims at the centre, this correspondent was informed that the
              local councillor visited on June 16. But the flood victims said
              they did not receive any government assistance yet. However, many
              locals have given them cooked or dry food a few times..

              "I first heard that the city corporation has a major initiative to
              deal with the flood victims. But one day later, I realised that
              there is no such initiative. Most shelters do not get government
              assistance. With the exception of a few councillors like Santu
              Dutt, most have never visited any shelter," he said. Contacted,
              Ruhul Alam, an executive engineer in charge of managing the
              shelters in the city, also spoke about the city corporation's
              helplessness.

              He said, "The district administration has so far allocated 30
              tonnes of rice and 500 packets of dry food. But no cash was given.
              In this situation, rice will not help people in the shelters and
              dry food is inadequate." "In some areas, councillors have stood by
              the flood victims on their own initiatives or in association with
              various voluntary organisations," he said, "We will start
              distributing dry foods on our own initiative from today (June 20,
              2022).
